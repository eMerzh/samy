You can write whatever you want in this file.
But the content must change each time we make a new version that is uploaded to AWS.
The goal of this file is to force Docker builder to retrieve the new version code from Git.
If there is no change in it, it will use the cache even if the code in the repo has changed.

send this zip file : >> zip aws_dev.zip Dockerfile Dockerrun.aws.json ./ssh_bitbucket/* docker_no_cache
